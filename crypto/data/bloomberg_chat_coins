"Chainlink is also another great one, 
if you think smart contracts will take off then chainlink is a good one to hold, and it holds pretty well, you don't see crazy drops.
They just don't market it very well hence why it hasn't been getting that much attention"

"ERIC HERDZIK
09:56:35 I think they are actively avoiding attention
09:56:48 But the whitepaper is pretty solid
09:58:06 Initially it will run in-contract on Ethereum and in long term they will pull it into its own chain with integration capabilities for any blockchain, i.e. ethereum, eos, cardano, etc.

"AMINE NEDJAI
