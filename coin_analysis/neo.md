#### NEO

- called chinesse ethereum
- make possible use of digital signatures. (both already happening in China and USA before NEO)
- <b>NEO Contract</b> - has API in all major programming languages
- <b> NEO FS </b> - peer to peer storage (like dropbox)

Because the Chinese government wants to make all developers use their platform, they are pushing towards adoption for NEO in order to be able to control the masses. 

- has advantage over ETH because it has more programming language choices


#### Downsides 
- You can't mine, it's all given out, means that the entire platform is centralized. 
- From the total 50 mil sold by crowdfounding while the other 50 mil is held by the 'NEO Council' 

Neo and GAS are interconnected meaning that if you have NEO, you gain GAS. There's 8 GAS per NEO block created. GAS is gained by NEO holders.

- GAS follows NEOs prices at a rate of 50%
- It is mostly a buy and hold thing if you want to have dividents. 
- GAS is considered to be undervalued since ICOs might start charging in GAS instead of NEO in the future

##### How much GAS can you make?

Definitely buy and hold if you want to generate money.
Worth calculating how much money you generate including the GAS accumulation. The gain is around 5% per year.
